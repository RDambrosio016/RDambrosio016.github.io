Hello! I am Riccardo D'Ambrosio, i am a high school senior with interests in programming. 
I primarily work with rust ðŸ¦€ and JavaScript/TypeScript. I work as a research intern at a computational biophysical chemistry
lab specializing in GPU-based 3d RNA structure prediction using C/C++. My main project is currently [RSLint](https://github.com/RDambrosio016/RSLint/tree/dev),
a fast and easy to use JavaScript linter written from scratch in Rust. I mainly use this blog to talk about my development
experiences and things i find interesting to talk about. 

If you have any questions about my work/projects/blog posts feel free to reach out to me at {{site.email}}
